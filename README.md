# General Information for Commands and Tutorial Material for the JHU/APL Omics Workshop

Please follow the instructions outlined at the [Wiki](https://github.com/jhuapl-bio/omics_workshop/wiki) for each day where we perform hands-on activities

## Updating at any point

If you feel that any install did not complete successfully, you can rerun `install.sh` in the appropriate directory or through `wsl.bat` and type in `y` to prompt a full reinstall OR `n` (default) to just update or install if not installed yet. 

For mac or linux, just rerun your one-line command `wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/jhuapl-bio/omics_workshop/raw/main/install.sh -O install.sh && bash install.sh`. 

**Hint** you can specify `-f` like `bash install.sh -f` to skip the prompt for y/n on a force install. It will set it to `y` by default.
